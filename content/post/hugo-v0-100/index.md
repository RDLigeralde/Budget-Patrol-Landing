This release is mostly motivated by the fix for the panic experienced by people having blackfriday configured as defaultMarkdownHandler ([#9968](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/9968)). The Blackfriday support was removed in Hugo v0.100.0 after being deprecated with a warning for a long time.

v0.100.1 fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file.

$page.RenderString (see [#6703](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/6703)) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.100.0.

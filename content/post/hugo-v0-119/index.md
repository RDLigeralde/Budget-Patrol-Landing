This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see [Issue 62196](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/62196) and [Issue 62197](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/62197). This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:

A new general-purpose [Process](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/#process) method and filter.
A new [Opacity](https://gohugo.io/functions/images/#opacity) filter.
